## Apicurio Community
The Apicurio community strives to provide high quality open source software in the API and Schema domains.  Apicurio
is an umbrella community (think Hibernate) containing multiple related projects.  Some of our top level projects
include:

* [Apicurio Studio](https://github.com/apicurio/apicurio-studio) (API/Schema Designer)
* [Apicurio Registry](https://github.com/apicurio/apicurio-registry) (API/Schema Runtime Registry)
* [Apicurio Data Models](https://github.com/apicurio/apicurio-data-models) (multi-language library to read/write/validate OpenAPI/AsyncAPI)
